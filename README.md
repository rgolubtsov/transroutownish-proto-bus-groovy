# Trans-RoutE-Townish (transroutownish) :small_blue_diamond: Urban bus routing microservice prototype (Groovy port)

**A daemon written in Groovy, designed and intended to be run as a microservice,
<br />implementing a simple urban bus routing prototype**

**Rationale:** This project is a *direct* **[Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org "Apache Groovy - A multi-faceted language for the Java platform")** port of the earlier developed **urban bus routing prototype**, written in Java using **[Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot "Stand-alone Spring apps builder and runner")** framework, and tailored to be run as a microservice in a Docker container. The following description of the underlying architecture and logics has been taken **[from there](https://github.com/rgolubtsov/transroutownish-proto-bus-spring-boot)** as is, without any modifications or adjustment.
